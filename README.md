# KeneThink – AI Agents for Startup Founders

This project is a React (Next.js) single-page app that visualizes how multiple AI agents can collaborate to help startup founders solve business problems.

## Scenario

The UI simulates a chat between two agents:
- **Agent Alpha** (Market Analyst)
- **Agent Beta** (Product Strategist)

They discuss:  
**"Build a sustainable meal delivery service for busy professionals."**

The conversation is shown as a modern, responsive chat interface, with a dedicated section for the formulated idea and key recommendations (target customers, USPs, challenges). Non-functional UI elements like "Add This Consideration", "Refine Idea", and "Explore Alternatives" are included for layout realism.

## Getting Started

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

## UX Rationale

The design focuses on clarity and flow - each agent's messages are visually distinct, making it easy to follow the debate. The "Formulated Idea" section summarizes the collaborative output, so founders can quickly grasp actionable insights. The interface is clean, modern, and fully responsive, ensuring a smooth experience on any device.
